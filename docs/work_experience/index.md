      <td><ul><li><strong>CR1</strong>. I designed and developed custom metrics, significantly improving observability across 3,000 servers, which enhanced troubleshooting efficiency and reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 50% for enterprise customers.</li><li><strong>CR2</strong>. I analyzed thread dumps and heap dumps to troubleshoot a critical server issue involving 2,000 concurrent threads, successfully resolving critical availability issues and enhancing system reliability for an enterprise customer with 100,000 employees.</li></ul></td>

    <tr>
      <td>Eukarya</td>
      <td><ul><li><strong>EU1</strong>. I developed a processor that compiles user scripts (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) into WebAssembly files and executes them efficiently on a WASM runtime. This significantly enhanced system extensibility, allowing users to customize their workflows with preferred scripting languages.</li><li><strong>EU2</strong>. I developed a real-time logging system for the workflow engine, efficiently leveraging storage (GCS) and cache (Redis). This provided users with real-time visibility into worker execution status, significantly improving monitoring efficiency.</li></ul></td>

      <td>enechain</td>
      <td><ul><li><strong>EN1</strong>. I developed a generator tool for Kubernetes manifests and Terraform configurations for new microservices. This streamlined the deployment process, achieving a 90% reduction in the initial setup and deployment time.</li><li><strong>EN2</strong>. I developed a system for local development by deploying Telepresence to the Kubernetes cluster, which accelerated local development cycles and led to a 15% improvement in microservice development speed.</li></ul></td>

    <tr>
      <td>Industry Technology</td>
      <td><ul><li><strong>IT1</strong>. I designed Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Objectives (SLOs), and developed custom metrics and tracing to significantly enhance system reliability. This strengthened customer trust, directly leading to securing a major enterprise contract.</li><li><strong>IT2</strong>. I developed a group chat service and a notification system enabling users to exchange photos, videos, and text messages. This improved user engagement and productivity by 25% by providing a seamless chat experience.</li><li><strong>IT3</strong>. I tuned database indexes and optimized queries, significantly improving database performance. This reduced slow query occurrences by 70% and stabilized peak-hour performance.</li><li><strong>IT4</strong>. I led the migration from a modular monolith to a microservices architecture to enhance system scalability. This distributed traffic for core features across microservices, reducing the write load on the main database.</li><li><strong>IT5</strong>. I managed the migration from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 to ensure long-term system reliability and maintainability, which resulted in a 20% increase in query performance.</li></ul></td>
