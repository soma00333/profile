      <td><strong>LX1</strong>. I developed a scalable notification system, which allowed a financial institution to track the workflow status, ensuring compliance with high-security standards</td>

      <td><strong>Situation</strong></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>A financial institution with 10,000 employees had no way to check the status of their workflows after triggering them.</li>
          <li>This led to uncertainty and inefficiency in their daily operations.</li>
        </ul>

      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>I developed the system using an event-driven architecture</li>
          <li>I deployed the system in a closed network:
            <ul>
              <li>I ensured the final system met all security requirements for that environment.</li>

        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

      <td><strong>Result</strong></td>
      <td>As a result, the system successfully provided secure and scalable workflow notifications. Users were kept informed of their progress.</td>

      <td><strong>Challenge</strong></td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Solution</strong></td>
      <td>To solve this, <ul>
          <li>I explicitly defined all necessary inbound and outbound traffic rules. These allowed essential communication while maintaining network isolation.</li>
          <li>I configured a secure firewall policy. It strictly controlled access to and from the notification system. This ensured compliance with security standards.</li>
