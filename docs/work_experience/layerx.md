    <tr>
      <td><strong>Summary</strong></td>
      <td><strong>LX1</strong>. I developed an event-driven notification system. It operates securely within a closed network environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Situation</strong></td>
      <td>Users had no way to check the status of their workflows after triggering them. This led to uncertainty and inefficiency.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Task</strong></td>
      <td>My mission was to develop a notification system that reliably informed users about their workflow execution status while following strict security protocols.</td>

      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>I designed system architecture
            <ul>
              <li>I designed an event-driven architecture to ensure scalability and real-time updates</li>
              <li>I planned the notification system to work within closed network constraints</li>

          <li>I implemented the system
            <ul>
              <li>I implemented the notification system using event-driven patterns</li>
              <li>I ensured the system met all security requirements for closed networks</li>

      <td><strong>Result</strong></td>
      <td>The system successfully enabled secure and scalable workflow notifications. Users were informed of progress. The system fully complied with high-security standards.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Challenge</strong></td>
      <td>A key challenge was the closed network environment. The system had to be deployed there. It had strict traffic control and access restrictions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Solution</strong></td>
      <td>
        To solve this:
        <ul>
          <li>I explicitly defined all necessary inbound and outbound traffic rules. These allowed essential communication while maintaining network isolation.</li>
          <li>I configured a secure firewall policy. It strictly controlled access to and from the notification system. This ensured compliance with security standards.</li>
        </ul>
