        <ul>
          <li>I removed a deprecated <code>--oss</code> flag and its associated logic from the <code>dev ui</code> subcommand to resolve technical debt and simplify the development workflow</li>

        <ul>
          <li>I developed a processor that compiled user scripts into WebAssembly files and executed them efficiently on a WASM runtime. This enhanced system extensibility and allowed users to customize workflows efficiently</li>
          <li>I developed a real-time logging system for the workflow engine. It leveraged storage and cache efficiently. This provided real-time visibility of worker execution status and enhanced monitoring efficiency</li>
        </ul>

          <li>I'm implementing <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1602-structured-logging">Structured Logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging">Contextual Logging</a> for multiple packages. This increases system reliability and debugging efficiency</li>

        <ul>
          <li>I added a workflow to guarantee that the import items were properly grouped and ordered. This improved code consistency and maintainability</li>
          <li>I enhanced the reconciliation logic to ensure that the number of replicas in the StatefulSet matched the number of etcd members in the cluster. This improved cluster consistency</li>

        <ul>
          <li>I added post-submit workflows that ran test and test-e2e. This ensured that CI ran even after merging to main in etcd-io/etcd-operator and enhanced its stability</li>
