          <li>I removed a deprecated --oss flag and its associated logic from the dev ui subcommand, which resolved technical debt and simplified the development workflow.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>I developed a processor that compiles user scripts into WebAssembly and executes them on a WASM runtime, which enabled users to customize workflows efficiently.</li>
          <li>I developed a real-time logging system with efficient storage and cache, which enabled users to monitor the workflow status instantly from the UI.</li>
