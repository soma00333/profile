| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [reearth/reearth-flow](https://github.com/reearth/reearth-flow) | Committer   | - Developed a processor that compiles user scripts into WebAssembly files and executes them efficiently on a WASM runtime, which enhanced system extensibility, allowing users to customize workflows efficiently<br>- Developed a real-time logging system for the workflow engine, leveraging storage and cache efficiently, which provided real-time visibility of worker execution status, enhancing monitoring efficiency |
| [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) | Contributor | - Implementing https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1602-structured-logging and https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging for multiple packages, which increase system reliability and debugging efficiency |
| [etcd-io/raft](https://github.com/etcd-io/raft)             | Contributor | - Refining the snapshot management logic by removing inefficiencies and streamlining related state transitions, which enhance clarity, maintainability, and robustness                                                                              |
| [etcd-io/etcd-operator](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd-operator) | Contributor | - Added a workflow to guarantee that the import items are properly grouped and ordered, which improved code consistency and maintainability<br>- Enhanced the reconciliation logic to ensure that the number of replicas in the StatefulSet matches the number of etcd members in the cluster, which improved cluster consistency |
| [kubernetes/test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra) | Contributor | - Added post-submit workflows that run test and test-e2e, ensuring that CI runs even after merging to main in etcd-io/etcd-operator, which enhanced its stability                                                                             |
| [envoyproxy/ai-gateway](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway) | Contributor | - Added a workflow to check the issue title and provide feedback, which improved the overall consistency of the project                                                                                                                       |
