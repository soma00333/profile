      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Area for Development:</strong> I sometimes tend to prioritize quality over speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Specific Example (New):</strong> At Industry Technology, I occasionally focused too much on details during code reviews, which sometimes caused delays in merging pull requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> My detailed reviews, while thorough, sometimes took longer than necessary, slowing down the overall review process.</li>
          <li><strong>Corrective Actions:</strong> To address this, I worked on enhancing our CI processes and introduced AI-powered review tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These actions helped improve PR merge speed while maintaining code quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> I learned the importance of finding the right balance between quality and agility.</li>

      <td><strong>Failure</strong></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Situation (New):</strong> At Industry Technology, I introduced an E2E (End-to-End) test automation tool for the frontend. My primary goal was to improve development efficiency by reducing the time frontend engineers spent writing tests. However, this unintentionally created communication silos between the frontend engineers and the QA team, hindering collaboration.</li>
          <li><strong>Remedial Actions:</strong> We discontinued the specific E2E test automation tool, and I reassigned E2E testing responsibilities directly to the frontend engineers, empowering them to own the quality of their code from development through testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Positive Outcome:</strong> This change eliminated the organizational silos and fostered better collaboration, ultimately leading to improved product quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> I learned that a tool or process that seems beneficial in isolation can have unintended negative consequences on team dynamics and overall workflow. Effective decision-making, especially regarding tooling, requires careful consideration of team size, composition, and existing workflows. Since then, I always prioritize understanding the broader team impact when making technical decisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> My objective was to improve system reliability to meet the expected operational level for this client.</li>
          <li><strong>My Approach:</strong> I made the decision to temporarily sacrifice some development agility to lead the introduction of SRE practices.</li>
          <li><strong>Successful Result:</strong> As a result, we successfully secured the contract with the enterprise customer.</li>

          <li><strong>Identified Problem:</strong> Developers were manually creating manifests and Terraform configurations for each new microservice, which was inefficient and prone to errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal:</strong> My goal was to automate the generation of these configurations to improve development efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I developed a generator tool to automate this process.</li>

          <li><strong>The Issue:</strong> A UI server was crashing occasionally for a large enterprise customer (100,000 employees). Resolving this incident was challenging due to the need for coordination across multiple teams (SRE, DevOps, Product, TAM).</li>
          <li><strong>My Objective:</strong> My objective was to identify the performance bottleneck and ensure system stability.</li>
          <li><strong>My Contribution:</strong> As the incident commander, I coordinated the efforts of different teams. I personally identified the root cause by analyzing thread dumps and heap dumps.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Summary (EU2):</strong> At Eukarya, I developed a real-time logging system for our workflow engine, which efficiently leveraged storage and caching.</li>
          <li><strong>The Need:</strong> Users required a way to monitor the execution status of the workflow engine in real time, but the system lacked an effective logging and retrieval mechanism.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My task was to develop a real-time logging system that allowed users to check workflow execution status via the UI.</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> I developed this feature using a Pub/Sub architecture with subscribers and publishers.</li>
          <li><strong>Key Challenge:</strong> A key challenge was the high-performance requirement, as users needed to monitor logs in real time.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution for Challenge:</strong> I overcame this by utilizing an optimized data storage strategy, using Redis for fast log retrieval (cache) and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for long-term log storage.</li>

          <li><strong>The Proposal:</strong> Management proposed migrating a large number of Google Cloud servers to Oracle Cloud.</li>
          <li><strong>My Initial Stance:</strong> I initially opposed this migration due to concerns about maintainability and attempted to persuade stakeholders with supporting data.</li>
          <li><strong>The Decision:</strong> However, the final decision to migrate was made based on cost considerations.</li>
          <li><strong>My Commitment:</strong> Once the decision was made, I fully committed to the project and played a role in successfully migrating the 5,000 servers.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Summary (IT4):</strong> At Industry Technology, I led the migration from a modular monolith to a microservices architecture to improve system scalability.</li>
          <li><strong>The Issue:</strong> The system was initially a modular monolith. As traffic to core features grew, the database write load increased, causing performance issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> My objective was to create independent microservices from the primary service to alleviate the increasing load.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution:</strong> I executed the migration to a microservices architecture, ensuring minimized downtime during the process.</li>

          <li><strong>Goal:</strong> My goal was to plan and implement strategies to improve these retention rates.</li>
          <li><strong>My Strategy:</strong> I focused on improving the initial experience for new users. Specifically, I implemented A/B tests that customized the initial content for new users based on the advertisements they had engaged with.</li>

          <li><strong>User Need:</strong> Users needed the ability to use their own scripts (in languages like Python, Go, Rust) to create custom functions within our workflow engine, requiring an extension to the engine for custom script execution.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My task was to extend the workflow engine to support user-defined scripts through WebAssembly execution.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution:</strong> I researched the technology, developed the feature, and created the necessary documentation.</li>

      <td><strong>Difficult Decision</strong></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Context (EN2):</strong> At enechain, our goal was to improve local development speed for microservices. We chose Telepresence because it allows developers to run a single service locally while connecting to dependencies in a remote Kubernetes cluster. This dramatically speeds up the develop-test-debug cycle. We deployed it via its official Helm chart.</li>
          <li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> While Telepresence offered the expected significant boost in development agility, its standard Helm chart did not meet our strict Kubernetes security requirements out-of-the-box. This presented a clear conflict: leverage the new development speed or ensure security compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>My Action & Resolution:</strong> I decided to harness the development benefits of Telepresence. To address the security concerns, I converted the helm chart to kustomize and added the necessary security patches.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome & Impact:</strong> This solution allowed us to achieve faster development cycles with Telepresence while maintaining our crucial security standards, successfully balancing agility with compliance.</li>

          <li><strong>The Constraint:</strong> We needed to develop a group chat system within a very tight schedule.</li>
          <li><strong>Pragmatic Decision:</strong> To meet the deadline, I made the pragmatic decision to use polling (which is simpler to implement, though less efficient) instead of WebSockets (more efficient but more complex). This allowed us to develop and deliver the group chat system on time.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> We successfully developed and delivered the expected system within the given timeframe.</li>
