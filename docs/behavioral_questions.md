        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> I sometimes focus too much on quality instead of agility.</li>
          <li><strong>Summary (New):</strong>At Industry Technology, I spent too much time on code reviews, which delayed PR merges.</li>
          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> My reviews took too much time and slowed down the team because I focused heavily on quality and detail.</li>

          <li><strong>Action:</strong> We stopped using the tool. I gave E2E testing to frontend engineers so they owned their code quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> As a result, teams worked better together and product quality improved.</li>

          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My mission was to automate this to save time.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I developed a generator tool even though it wasn't my main mission.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> As a result, new microservices were deployed much faster for all teams.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Users needed to monitor workflow status right away after execution, but we had no good logging mechanism.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My mission was to build real-time logging system with cost efficient architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I used Pub/Sub design with Redis cache and GCS for storage.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Summary (New):</strong> I disagreed with an engineering manager about migrating 3,000 servers, which led to a better migration strategy after discussions.</li>
          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Management and engineering managers wanted to migrate some servers from Google Cloud to Oracle Cloud within 6 months to save infrastructure costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My mission was to share my technical concerns while supporting business goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>First, I disagreed and presented specific data:
                <ul>
                  <li>I showed that multi-cloud complexity would increase ops burden by 50%</li>
                  <li>I explained that our team had no Oracle Cloud expertise</li>
                  <li>I calculated that API differences would require 3 months of code changes</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>After that, I proposed a compromise solution:
                <ul>
                  <li>We should start with non-critical services as a pilot</li>
                  <li>We could hire Oracle support engineers as consultants</li>
                  <li>We would migrate core services only after pilot success with proper planning</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>After discussions with an engineering manager, we agreed on a phased migration plan with Oracle consultants to guide us.</li>
              <li>Finally, once the decision was made, I fully committed to the plan and helped the migration.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> As a result, we migrated successfully and saved significant infrastructure costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> I learned that effective conflict resolution requires "disagree and commit" - voice concerns with data, but once a decision is made, fully support it and work toward success.</li>

          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My mission was to help him grow without slowing our work.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I did regular 1-on-1s and made learning docs for him.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> As a result, he became a lead backend engineer. Our docs also helped train all new engineers.</li>
