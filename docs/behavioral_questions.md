        <ul>
          <li><strong>Area for Development:</strong> I sometimes tend to prioritize quality over speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Specific Example (New):</strong> At Industry Technology, I occasionally focused too much on details during code reviews, which sometimes caused delays in merging pull requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> My detailed reviews, while thorough, sometimes took longer than necessary, slowing down the overall review process.</li>
          <li><strong>Corrective Actions:</strong> To address this, I worked on enhancing our CI processes and introduced AI-powered review tools.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Summary (New):</strong> At Industry Technology, I introduced an E2E test automation tool that accidentally created team silos.</li>
          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> I introduced an E2E test automation tool for the frontend to improve development efficiency by reducing the time frontend engineers spent writing tests. However, this accidentally created communication silos between the frontend engineers and the QA team, which hurt collaboration.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> We stopped using the specific E2E test automation tool, and I gave E2E testing responsibilities directly to the frontend engineers. This let them own the quality of their code from development through testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> This change removed the team silos and improved collaboration, which led to better product quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> I learned that technical decisions, especially about tools, must consider how they affect the whole team beyond just individual benefits.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> We had a chance to sell our system to Japan's largest real estate company, but I realized our operations didn't meet their service requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My goal was to improve system reliability to meet this client's needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I decided to slow down development temporarily to introduce SRE practices. I designed SLI/SLO and developed custom metrics and tracing.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> We successfully secured the contract with the enterprise customer.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Developers were manually creating manifests and Terraform configurations for each new microservice, which was slow and led to mistakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My goal was to automate the generation of these configurations to improve development efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I developed a generator tool to automate this process, even though it wasn't my assigned task.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> This tool significantly reduced the initial deployment time for new microservices across all teams.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> A UI server was crashing sometimes for a large enterprise customer. Fixing this was hard because we needed to coordinate many teams (SRE, DevOps, Product, TAM).</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My goal was to find the performance problem and make the system stable.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> As the incident commander, I coordinated different teams. I analyzed thread dumps and heap dumps myself to find the root cause.</li>

          <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Management proposed migrating a large number of Google Cloud servers to Oracle Cloud.</li>
          <li><strong>Initial Stance:</strong> I first opposed this migration because I was worried about maintainability and showed data to support my concerns.</li>
          <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> When the final decision was made based on cost, I fully committed to the project and played a role in successfully migrating the 5,000 servers.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> The system started as a modular monolith. As traffic grew to core features, the database write load increased and caused performance problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My goal was to create separate microservices from the main service to reduce the load.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I carried out the migration to microservices, keeping downtime minimal.</li>

          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My goal was to create a new strategy to fix this trend and improve user engagement from their first use.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I thought that showing new users content based on ads they clicked before joining would be more engaging. I designed and ran A/B tests where new users got customized content based on ads they had clicked.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> This personalized A/B testing worked much better than standard methods and increased 7-day user retention by 10%.</li>

          <li><strong>Situation:</strong> We used Telepresence with its Helm chart to speed up microservice development. However, its standard Helm chart didn't meet our strict Kubernetes security requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Task:</strong> I had to choose between using faster development speed and keeping full security compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I customized the Telepresence Helm chart to work with Kustomize, which let me apply needed security patches while keeping the development benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> This custom approach let us use Telepresence's faster development cycles while meeting our security standards, improving development speed by 15%.</li>

          <li><strong>Task:</strong> My task was to review and approve 15 pull requests from 3 developers before the release deadline.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> I conducted extremely thorough code reviews, often requesting multiple rounds of changes for minor improvements. I spent hours reviewing each PR, checking every edge case and suggesting optimizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> We missed the release deadline by 3 days because PRs were stuck in review. The delay affected our marketing campaign and disappointed stakeholders.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> I learned that perfectionism can harm delivery. Now I focus on critical issues first and use automated tools for style checks. I also set time limits for reviews and clearly distinguish between must-fix issues and nice-to-have improvements.</li>
