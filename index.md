### About Me

Hi there! I’m Soma, a Senior Backend Engineer who loves building reliable, scalable systems that help businesses thrive. I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Alpaca Markets, a U.S.-based fintech company that supports more than 200 partners across 40 countries in their mission to open financial access. My role is to keep our ultra-low-latency Broker API rock solid, meeting targets such as 1.5 ms median latency and 99.99 % availability. Outside of work, I actively contribute to open-source projects such as Kubernetes, etcd, Raft, and a workflow engine. I’m also pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder through their online program, which lets me study remotely from Japan.

### Early Career

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Tokyo, where I developed statistical models in Python to improve medical decision making. This work culminated in a published paper. During university, I interned at several startups in Tokyo, where I discovered my passion for backend development. 
My professional journey began as a Data Analyst at Gunosy, one of Japan’s leading media apps with more than 40 million users. There, I optimized advertising performance through large-scale data analysis. I then co-founded Industry Technology, a Tokyo-based company that delivers enterprise applications for real-estate firms. As CTO, I built entire backend systems from scratch and introduced SRE practices to ensure reliability and scalability.

Later, I joined Cybereason as a Software Engineer, helping to operate a distributed cybersecurity platform that processes more than 80 million events per second across 12,000+ servers. In this role, I focused on hardening system reliability, improving observability, and leading incident response initiatives. In parallel with these roles, I have contributed to several AI/LLM-focused startups as side projects, designing and improving backend systems. This experience ultimately paved the way for my current work at Alpaca.

### Vision

I firmly believe that reliability is a product's core feature, and my mission is to advance the reliability of distributed systems at scale. With a focus on modern cloud-native technologies, I'm continuously growing and expanding my expertise in reliability. I'm passionate about learning and embracing new challenges along the way.
