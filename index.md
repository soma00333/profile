### About Me

Hello and welcome! I'm Soma, a Software Engineer passionate about building reliable and scalable systems that empower businesses worldwide. I work as a Software Engineer at Cybereason, a US-based cybersecurity company operating across 40+ countries. My role focuses on ensuring the reliability of a distributed system handling 80M+ events per second and managing 12,000+ servers. Beyond my full-time role, I actively contribute to open-source projects, including initiatives like Kubernetes, etcd, Raft, and ETL tool. I'm also enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying online from Japan.

### Early Career

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Tokyo, where I developed statistical models in Python to improve medical decision-making, culminating in a published paper. During this time, I interned at several startups in Tokyo, where I began honing my backend development skills. My professional journey started as a Data Analyst at Gunosy, one of Japan's most prominent media app companies, with 40M+ users. Here, I worked on large-scale data analysis to optimize ads. After that, I co-founded Industry Technology, a Tokyo-based company providing enterprise applications for real estate companies. As the CTO, I led the development team, built backend systems from the ground up, and introduced SRE practices to ensure the reliability and scalability of our platforms. I've also contributed as a Software Engineer for several AI/LLM-focused startups, designing and improving backend systems and infrastructure as part of side projects.

### Vision

I firmly believe that reliability is a product's core feature, and my mission is to advance the reliability of distributed systems at scale. With a focus on modern cloud-native technologies, I'm continuously growing and expanding my expertise in reliability. I'm passionate about learning and embracing new challenges along the way.
