# About

### Summary

- <strong>Role</strong>: I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience specializing in reliability engineering.
- <strong>Experience</strong>: I have developed enterprise-grade distributed systems in startup environments, effectively balancing reliability and agility.
- <strong>Skills</strong>: Go, Java, Kubernetes

### About Me

Hi there! I'm Soma, a Software Engineer who loves building reliable, scalable systems to accelerate startup growth. Outside of work, I actively contribute to open-source projects, including Kubernetes, etcd, Raft, and a workflow engine. I'm also pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at CU Boulder through their online program, which lets me study remotely from Japan.

### Early Career

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Tokyo, where I developed statistical models in Python to improve medical decision-making. This work culminated in a published paper. During my university years, I interned at several startups as a Backend Engineer, where I discovered my passion for the field. 
My professional journey began as a Data Analyst at Gunosy, one of Japan's leading media apps with 40 million users. There, I optimized advertising performance through large-scale data analysis. I then co-founded Industry Technology, a Tokyo-based company that delivers enterprise applications to real estate firms. As CTO, I built entire backend systems from scratch and introduced SRE practices to ensure reliability and scalability.

Later, I joined Cybereason as a Software Engineer, helping to operate a distributed cybersecurity platform that processes 80 million events per second across 12,000 servers worldwide. In this role, I focused on hardening system reliability, improving observability, and leading incident response initiatives. In parallel with these roles, I have contributed to several AI/LLM-focused startups as side projects, designing and improving backend systems.

### Vision
  
I believe reliability is a product's core feature, but for startups, agility is just as critical. My mission is to build distributed systems that master the balance between speed and stability. Using LLM and cloud-native technologies, I create resilient platforms that empower teams to innovate fast and drive sustainable growth.
