### About Me

Hello and welcome! I'm Soma, a Software Engineer passionate about building reliable and scalable systems that empower businesses worldwide. I work as a Software Engineer at Cybereason, a US-based cybersecurity company operating across 40+ countries. My role focuses on ensuring the reliability of a distributed system handling 80M+ events per second and managing 12,000+ servers. Beyond my full-time role, I actively contribute to open-source projects, including initiatives like Kubernetes, etcd, Raft, and ETL tool. Iâ€™m also enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying online from Japan. 

### Early Career

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Tokyo, where I developed statistical models in Python to improve medical decision-making, culminating in a published paper. During this time, I interned at several startups in Tokyo, where I began honing my backend development skills. My professional journey started as a Data Analyst at Gunosy, one of Japan's most prominent media app companies, with 40M+ users. Here, I worked on large-scale data analysis to optimize ads. After that, I co-founded Industry Technology, a Tokyo-based company providing enterprise applications for real estate companies. As the CTO, I led the development team, built backend systems from the ground up, and introduced SRE practices to ensure the reliability and scalability of our platforms. I've also contributed as a Software Engineer for several AI/LLM-focused startups, designing and improving backend systems and infrastructure as part of side projects.

### Vision

I firmly believe that reliability is a product's core feature, and my mission is to advance the reliability of distributed systems at scale. With a focus on modern cloud-native technologies, I'm continuously growing and expanding my expertise in reliability. I'm passionate about learning and embracing new challenges along the way.
