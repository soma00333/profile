Value1: - Summary: EU1. Developed a processor that compiles user scripts into WebAssembly files and executes them efficiently on a WASM runtime at Eukarya
- Problem:
  - Custom Functionality: Users wanted to use their scripts (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) to create custom functions in the workflow engine
  - Extensibility: There was a need to extend the engine for custom script execution
- Mission: Extend the workflow engine to support user-defined scripts via WebAssembly execution
- Action: 
  - Researched and developed the feature
  - Created documentation
- Result:
  - Provided users with useful features
  - Built a knowledge base about WASM for the team
