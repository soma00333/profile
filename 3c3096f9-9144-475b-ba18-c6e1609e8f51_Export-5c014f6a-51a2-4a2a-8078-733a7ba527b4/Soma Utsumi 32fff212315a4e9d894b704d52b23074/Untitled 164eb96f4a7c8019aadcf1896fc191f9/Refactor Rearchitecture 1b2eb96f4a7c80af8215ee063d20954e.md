# Refactor/Rearchitecture

Value1: - Summary: IT4. Migrated from a modular monolith to a microservices architecture to improve scalability at Industry Technology
- Problem:
  - Monolithic Architecture: The system was initially built as a modular monolith
  - Increased Database Load: Traffic to core features grew, leading to increased write load on the database
- Mission: Create independent microservices from the primary serviceÂ to address the increasing load
- Action: I migrated to microservices architecture with minimized downtime
- Result: It simplified the architecture and improved the database performance
