# Why searching a new position

Value1: - Current Environment: I’m satisfied with my current work environment, so I’m not actively looking for a new position
- Passion: I have a strong desire to grow by being involved in large-scale products and taking on more responsibility, like a senior position
- Near Future: I’m planning to relocate to the US, so I’m looking for positions related to the US to get visa support in the future
