# Failure

Value1: - Summary: (New) Introducing an E2E test automation tool led to organizational silos between frontend engineers and QA at Industry Technology
- Situation
  - I introduced an E2E test automation tool for the frontend
  - This unintentionally created silos between frontend engineers and QA
- Action
  - Discontinued the tool
  - Reassigned E2E testing responsibilities to frontend engineers
- Result: The organizational silos were eliminated, leading to improved product quality
- Learned:
 - Effective decision-making varies depending on team size and composition
 - Since then, I have prioritized considering the impact on the team when making technical decisions
