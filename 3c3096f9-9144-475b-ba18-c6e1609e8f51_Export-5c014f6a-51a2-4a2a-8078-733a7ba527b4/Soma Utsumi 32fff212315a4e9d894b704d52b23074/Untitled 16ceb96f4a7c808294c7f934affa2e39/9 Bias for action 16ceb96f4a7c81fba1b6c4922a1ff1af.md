# 9. Bias for action

Value: - Value: Speed matters in business. Leaders take calculated risks
- Project: EN2. Developed a system for local development by deploying Telepresence to the Kubernetes cluster
  - At: enechain Corporation
  - Situation:
    - Each microservice depended on the others
    - Slowed down the local development speed
  - Action: 
    - Decided to introduce Telepresence (OSS to help create a local development environment)
    - It lowered security standards, so I limited the scope to the dev cluster and added security patches
  - Result: Minimized security risks and improved the development speed
