Summary,,EN1. Developed a generator tool for manifests and Terraform configurations for new microservices
Problem,,"- Manual Configuration: Developers had to create manifests and Terraform configurations for each new microservice manually
- Inefficiency & Errors: The process was time-consuming and error-prone"
Mission,,- Automate the generation of manifests and Terraform configurations to enhance development efficiency
Action,,"- Develop a generator tool
  - Command-Line Tool: Implemented a command line tool using Go
  - Template System: Created a template to generate standardized configurations"
Challenge,,"Version Management: If developers used an outdated CLI version, incorrect templates would be generated"
Overcome,,"- CI Integration : Configured the CLI client to only trigger the CI, while managing the main logic within the CI to ensure it is always up to date"
Result,,"- Streamlined the deployment process, achieving a 90% reduction in the initial deployment time for new microservices"
