Summary,,EN2. Developed a system for local development by deploying Telepresence to the Kubernetes cluster
Problem,,"- Dependency on Other Microservices: Local development was dependent on other microservices
- Complex Setup: Setting up a local environment was time-consuming"
Mission,,- Enable efficient local development without depending on other microservices
Action,,"- Deploy Telepresence: Enabled interaction with other microservices in the cluster from the local environment
- Develop a Local Development System: Utilized Devcontainer for streamlined development"
Challenge,,"- High-Security Requirement:
  - We had robust security standards for our Kubernetes clusters
  - But official Helm charts didn’t support modifying security configurations"
Overcome,,"- Customizing Helm Charts: Converted Helm charts to Kustomize
- Manual Security Enhancements: Added security patches manually
    - Pod Security Admission
    - NetworkPolicy
    - Security Context"
Result,,"- Accelerated local development, achieving a 15% improvement in microservice development speed"
