Summary,CR2. Analyzed thread dumps and heap dumps to troubleshoot a server with 2k concurrent threads
Problem,"- Crash: A UI server crashed occasionally for an enterprise customer with 100k employees
- Troubleshooting Difficulty: The root cause was unknown, and conventional monitoring tools provided insufficient insights"
Mission,- Identify the performance bottleneck and ensure system stability
Action,"- Root Cause Analysis:
  - Fetched and analyzed thread dumps and heap dumps
  - Found that a legacy API blocked HTTP threads, triggering health check failures and causing automatic restarts
- Response: Migrated the legacy API to an efficient v2 API, resolving the issue"
Challenge,"- Fetching Data: Since an automated pipeline restarted the UI server upon failure, manual thread and heap dumps could not be obtained"
Overcome,- Pipeline: Added an automated pipeline to collect thread and heap dumps before restart
Result,"- Successfully resolved critical availability issues, enhancing system reliability for the enterprise customer with 100k employees"
Skill,- Incident Response / Troubleshooting
