Summary,EU1. Developed a processor that compiles user scripts into WebAssembly files and executes them efficiently on a WASM runtime
Problem,"- Custom Functionality: Users wanted to use their scripts (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) to create custom functions in the workflow engine
- Extensibility: There was a need to extend the engine for custom script execution"
Mission,- Extend the workflow engine to support user-defined scripts via WebAssembly execution
Action,"- Develop the extension: 
  - Compiler: Compile custom scripts into .wasm
  - Runtime: Execute scripts on a WebAssembly runtime"
Challenge,"- Execution Control: If the execution environment was too flexible, unintended executions could occur, posing security risks"
Overcome,- Used the WebAssembly specification to pass variables within an appropriate scope
Result,"- Enhanced system extensibility, allowing users to customize workflows efficiently "
