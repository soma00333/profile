Summary,,"EU2. Developed a real-time logging system for a workflow engine, leveraging storage and cache efficiently"
Problem,,"- Real-Time Monitoring Need: Users needed to monitor the execution status of the workflow engine in real time
- Lack of Logging Mechanism: The system lacked an effective mechanism for logging and retrieving workflow status"
Mission,,- Develop a real-time logging system that allows users to check workflow execution status from the UI
Action,,"- Develop the feature
  - Workflow Engine: Added a publisher to publish logs to Pub/Sub
  - Subscriber: Created a subscriber to subscribe logs from Pub/Sub and write to a datastore
  - API: Added a resolver to read logs from the datastore"
Challenge,,- High-Performance Requirement: Users needed to monitor the logs output by the workflow engine in real time
Overcome,,"- Utilized optimized datastore
  - Cache: Redis for fast log retrieval
  - Permanent Storage: GCS for long-term log storage"
Result,,"- Provided real-time visibility of worker execution status, enhancing monitoring efficiency"
