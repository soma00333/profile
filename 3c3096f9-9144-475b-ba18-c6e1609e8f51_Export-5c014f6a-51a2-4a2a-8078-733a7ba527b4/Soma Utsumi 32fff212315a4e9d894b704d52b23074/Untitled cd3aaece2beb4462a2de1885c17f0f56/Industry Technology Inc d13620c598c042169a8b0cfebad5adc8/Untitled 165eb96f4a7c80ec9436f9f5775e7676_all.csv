Summary,,IT3. Tuned indexes and optimized queries to improve database performance
Problem,,"- Frequent Slow Queries: A core feature suffered from repeated slow queries, impacting user experience.
- High CPU & Memory Utilization: Slow queries led to CPU and memory spikes, especially during peak hours (09:00 AM)"
Mission,,"- Diagnose performance bottlenecks
- Optimize query execution"
Action,,"- Index Optimization: Implemented appropriate indexes to improve query performance
- Query Refactoring: 
  - Eliminated unnecessary joins
  - Optimized queries to utilize indexes efficiently"
Challenge,,- Root Cause Analysis: Identifying the exact source of slow queries was challenging due to complex query execution patterns
Overcome,,"- Query Tracing: Monitored and analyzed tracing to detect anomalies
- EXPLAIN Analysis: Used EXPLAIN statements to identify queries performing full table scans without indexes"
Result,,"- Reduced slow query occurrences by 70%, stabilizing peak-hour performance"
