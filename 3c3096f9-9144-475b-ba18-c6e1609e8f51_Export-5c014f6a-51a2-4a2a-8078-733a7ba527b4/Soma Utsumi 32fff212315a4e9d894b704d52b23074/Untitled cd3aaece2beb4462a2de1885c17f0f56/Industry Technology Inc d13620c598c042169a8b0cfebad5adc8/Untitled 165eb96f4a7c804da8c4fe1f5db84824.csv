Summary,IT4. Migrated from a modular monolith to a microservices architecture to improve scalability
Problem,"- Monolithic Architecture: The system was initially built as a modular monolit
- Increased Database Load: Traffic to core features grew, leading to increased write load on the database"
Mission,- Create independent microservices from the primary service to address the increasing load
Action,"- Migrated to microservices step-by-step
  - Created three microservices:
    - Work Diary
    - Attendance Management
    - Main"
Challenge,- Downtime Minimization: We needed to achieve the migration while minimizing downtime
Overcome,"- BFF-Based Traffic Management: Added a BFF layer in front of the microservices and gradually switched traffic to each service, enabling a seamless migration"
Result,"- Distributed traffic to core features across microservices, reducing the write load on the database"
